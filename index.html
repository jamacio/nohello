  <h2 id="tldr" data-translate="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
  <p data-translate="tldr-description">Modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all
    participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information. <strong>Don’t expect an answer if you
      just write “Hello” in chat</strong>. Don’t call someone out of the blue. Instead, phrase a message that allows
    your chat partners to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message.
  </p>
  <h2 id="chat-etiquette" data-translate="chat-etiquette">Chat Etiquette</h2>
  <pre class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hello
  2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hi.
  # CO-WORKER WAITS WHILE YOU PHRASE YOUR QUESTION
  2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]
  2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that&#39;s [answer...]</code></pre>
  <p data-translate="phone-analogy">It’s as if you called someone on the phone and said “Hello!” and then put them on
    hold!</p>
  <p data-translate="better-approach">Please do this instead:</p>
  <pre class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hello -- I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]
  2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]</code></pre>
  <p data-translate="faster-help">Note that you get help minutes sooner, and you don’t make them wait. Instead, the
    co-worker can start thinking about your question right away!</p>
  <p data-translate="politeness">You’re trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in
    person or on the phone. But Chat is neither of those things. Typing is much slower than talking. Instead of being
    polite, you are just making the other person wait for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity.</p>
  <p data-translate="common-phrases">The same goes for “Hello – Are you there?”, “Hi Bob – quick question.”, “Do you
    have a sec ?”, “yt?” and “ping”. Just ask the question!</p>
  <p data-translate="polite-question">If you feel it’s brusque to simply say “Hi” and ask the question, you can do
    something like this:</p>
  <pre
    class="text"><code>2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- if you&#39;re not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question. I&#39;m working on [something] and I&#39;m trying to do [etc...]</code></pre>
  <p data-translate="asynchronous-communication">Additionally, asking your question before getting a reply allows
    asynchronous communication. If the other party is away, and you leave before they come back, they can still answer
    your question, instead of just staring at a “Hello” and wondering what they missed.</p>
  <h2 id="call-etiquette" data-translate="call-etiquette">Call Etiquette</h2>
  <p data-translate="no-cold-calls">Don’t call someone out of the blue. Respect that your desired call partner might be
    busy and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>. Calling someone means you request
    immediate, full attention, interrupting any other activity. Some people like to probe with an initial “hello” to
    verify whether the presence status shown is true, hoping they can determine whether the recipient is near a device,
    then will immediately follow up with a call. Don’t do that either. If someone is able and willing to answer a chat
    message, it does not mean that they are also available for a voice or video call.</p>
  <p data-translate="better-call-request">Instead of sending a call probe, or asking “hey, do you have time for a call?”
    (which is better but not great), you can try something like this:</p>
  <pre
    class="text"><code>2020-07-08 12:32:12 you: Hi - do you have X min for a quick call to talk about XYZ? [etc...]</code></pre>
  <p data-translate="call-request-benefits">This does three things: it time bounds the request, it gives the recipient
    some context, and it helps you remember what you wanted to talk about if the recipient can’t or doesn’t respond
    until later.</p>
