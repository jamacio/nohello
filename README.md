# Nohello

This is the repository for the [Nohello](https://jamacio.github.io/nohello/) website.

## About

The goal of the Nohello website is to promote more efficient and productive communication in chats. Often, people start conversations with a simple "Hello" or "Hi," which can cause delays in communication as the recipient has to wait for the question or context. This site offers tips and examples on how to start conversations more directly and efficiently.

## Chat Etiquette

- Avoid starting conversations with just "Hello" or "Hi."
- Include your question or context in the initial message.
- Allow communication to be asynchronous by providing all necessary information from the start.

## Call Etiquette

- Do not call someone without prior notice.
- Respect others' time and focus.
- Request a call by informing the necessary time and the subject to be discussed.
